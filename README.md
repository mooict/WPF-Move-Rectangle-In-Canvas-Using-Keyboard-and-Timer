# WPF-Move-Rectangle-In-Canvas-Using-Keyboard-and-Timer

In this tutorial we will learn how to make a object move in 4 directions using the keyboard with wpf and c# inside of visual studio. Most games have this movement and we will most certainly make use of this movement for games development in wpf and c#. for this tutorial we will focus more on the moment for the player and also animate another box that will move between the borders from left to right. The player character will move up, down, left and right also we will need to stop the character when it hits any of the 4 borders. We will be using our trusted canvas element inside of the wpf format and for the first time use dispatcher time which is kind of same as the timer as used in the windows form games development examples. Hopefully you find this tutorial insightful and inspires you to make something cool with it.
